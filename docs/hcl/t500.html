				It is believed that all or most T500 laptops are compatible. 
				See notes about <a href="../install/t500_external.html#cpu_compatibility">CPU compatibility</a>
				for potential incompatibilities.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				There are two possible flash chip sizes for the T500: 4MiB (32Mbit) or 8MiB (64Mbit). 
				This can be identified by the type of flash chip below the palmrest: 4MiB is SOIC-8, 8MiB
				is SOIC-16.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				<b>The T500 laptops come with the ME (and sometimes AMT in addition) before flashing libreboot. Libreboot disables and removes it
				by using a modified descriptor: see <a href="gm45_remove_me.html">gm45_remove_me.html</a></b> (contains notes, plus
				instructions)
			</p>

					<p>
						The T500, when run without CPU microcode updates in coreboot, currently kernel panics
						if running QEMU with vt-x enabled on 2 cores for the guest. With a single core enabled
						for the guest, the guest panics (but the host is fine). Working around this in QEMU
						might be possible; if not, software virtualization should work fine (it's just slower).
					</p>
					<p>
						On GM45 hardware (with libreboot), make sure that the <i>kvm</i> and <i>kvm_intel</i> kernel modules
						are not loaded, when using QEMU.
					</p>
					<p>
						The following errata datasheet from Intel might help with investigation:

			Descriptor and Gbe differences

				See
				<a href="../future/dumps/t500_x200_descriptor/descriptor_diff_t500_x200.txt">../future/dumps/t500_x200_descriptor/descriptor_diff_t500_x200.txt</a>
				and
				<a href="../future/dumps/t500_x200_descriptor/gbe_diff_t500_x200.txt">../future/dumps/t500_x200_descriptor/gbe_diff_t500_x200.txt</a>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The patches above are based on the output from ich9deblob on a factory.rom image dumped from the T500
				with a SOIC-8 4MiB flash chip. The patch re-creates the X200 descriptor/gbe source, so the commands were
				something like:<br/>
				$ <b>diff -u t500gbe x200gbe</b><br/>
				$ <b>diff -u t500descriptor x200descriptor</b>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				ME VSCC table is in a different place and a different size on the T500. Libreboot disables and removes the ME
				anyway, so it doesn't matter.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The very same descriptor/gbe used on the X200 (generated by <a href="gm45_remove_me.html#ich9gen">ich9gen</a>)
				was re-used on the T500, and it still worked.
