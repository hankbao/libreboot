		<h1 id="pagetop">ASUS KFSN4-DRE server/workstation board</h1>

			<p>
				This is a server board using AMD hardware (Fam10h). It can also be used
				for building a high-powered workstation. Powered by libreboot.
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>
					NOTE: This board is unsupported in libreboot 20150518.
					To use it in libreboot, for now, you must build for it
					from source using the libreboot git repository.
				</b>
			</p>

			<p>
				Flashing instructions can be found at <a href="../install/index.html#flashrom">../install/index.html#flashrom</a>

		<h1 id="formfactor">Form factor</h1>
			<p>
				These boards use the SSI EEB 3.61 form factor; make sure
				that your case supports this. This form factor is similar
				to E-ATX in that the size is identical, but the position of
				the screws are different.
			</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="section">
		<h1 id="flashchips">Flash chips</h1>
			<p>
				These boards use LPC flash (not SPI), in a PLCC socket. The default flash size
				1MiB (8Mbits), and can be upgraded to 2MiB (16Mbits).
				SST49LF080A is the default that the board uses.
				SST49LF016C is an example of a 2MiB (16Mbits) chip, which might work.
				It is believed that 2MiB (16Mbits) is the maximum size available for the flash chip.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>
					DO NOT hot-swap the chip with your bare hands. Use a PLCC
					chip extractor. These can be found online.
					See <a href="http://www.coreboot.org/Developer_Manual/Tools#Chip_removal_tools">http://www.coreboot.org/Developer_Manual/Tools#Chip_removal_tools</a>

	<div class="section">
		<h1 id="graphics">Native graphics initialization</h1>
			<p>
				Native graphics initialization exists (XGI Z9s) for this board.
				Framebuffer- and text-mode both work. A serial port is also
				available.
			</p>
	</div>

	<div class="section">
		<h1>Memory</h1>
			<p>
				DDR2 533/667 Registered ECC. 16 slots. Total capacity up to 64GiB.
			</p>
	</div>

	<div class="section">
		<h1 id="hexcore">Hex-core CPUs</h1>
			<p>
				PCB revision 1.05G is the best version of this board (the
				revision number will be printed on the board), because it
				can use dual hex-core CPUs (Opteron 2400/8400 series). Other
				revisions are believed to only support dual quad-core CPUs.

		<h1 id="issues">Current issues</h1>
			<ul>
				<li>
					There seems to be a 30 second bootblock delay (observed by tpearson);
					the system otherwise boots and works as expected.
					See <a href="text/kfsn4-dre/bootlog.txt">text/kfsn4-dre/bootlog.txt</a>
					- this uses the 'simple' bootblock, while tpearson uses the 'normal'
					bootblock, which tpearson suspects may be a possible cause.
					This person says that they will look into it.
					<a href="http://review.coreboot.org/gitweb?p=board-status.git;a=blob;f=asus/kfsn4-dre/4.0-10101-g039edeb/2015-06-27T03:59:16Z/config.txt;h=4742905c185a93fbda8eb14322dd82c70641aef0;hb=055f5df4e000a97453dfad6c91c2d06ea22b8545">This config</a> doesn't have the issue.
				</li>
				<li>
					Text-mode is a bit jittery (but still usable). (the jitter disappears
					if using KMS, once the kernel starts. The jitter will remain, if
					booting the kernel in text-mode).
