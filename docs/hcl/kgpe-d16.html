		<h1 id="pagetop">ASUS KGPE-D16 server/workstation board</h1>

			<p>
				This is a server board using AMD hardware (Fam10h <b>and Fam15h</b> CPUs available). It can also be used
				for building a high-powered workstation. Powered by libreboot. The coreboot port was done by
				Timothy Pearson of <a href="https://raptorengineeringinc.com/">Raptor Engineering Inc.</a> and,
				working with Timothy (and sponsoring the work) merged into libreboot.
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>
					NOTE: This board is unsupported in libreboot 20150518.
					To use it in libreboot, for now, you must build for it
					from source using the libreboot git repository.
				</b>
			</p>

			<p>
				Flashing instructions can be found at <a href="../install/index.html#flashrom">../install/index.html#flashrom</a>
				- note that external flashing is required (e.g. BBB), if the proprietary (ASUS) firmware is currently installed.
				If you already have libreboot, by default it is possible to re-flash using software running in GNU/Linux
				on the KGPE-D16, without using external hardware.

		<h1 id="formfactor">Form factor</h1>
			<p>
				These boards use the SSI EEB 3.61 form factor; make sure
				that your case supports this. This form factor is similar
				to E-ATX in that the size is identical, but the position of
				the screws are different.

		<h1 id="ipmi">IPMI iKVM module add-on</h1>
			<p>
				Don't use it. It uses proprietary firmware and adds a backdoor (remote out-of-band management chip,
				similar to the <a href="http://libreboot.org/faq/#intelme">Intel Management Engine</a>. Fortunately,
				the firmware is unsigned (possibly to replace) and physically separate from the mainboard since it's
				on the add-on module, which you don't have to install.

		<h1 id="flashchips">Flash chips</h1>
			<p>
				2MiB flash chips are included by default, on these boards. It's on a P-DIP 8 slot (SPI chip).
				The flash chip can be upgraded to higher sizes: 4MiB, 8MiB or 16MiB. With at least 8MiB,
				you could feasibly fit a compressed linux+initramfs image (BusyBox+Linux system) into CBFS
				and boot that, loading it into memory.
			</p>
			<p>
				Libreboot has configs for 2, 4, 8 and 16 MiB flash chip sizes (default flash chip is 2MiB).
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>
					DO NOT hot-swap the chip with your bare hands. Use a P-DIP 8
					chip extractor. These can be found online.
					See <a href="http://www.coreboot.org/Developer_Manual/Tools#Chip_removal_tools">http://www.coreboot.org/Developer_Manual/Tools#Chip_removal_tools</a>

		<h1 id="issues">Current issues</h1>
			<ul>
				<li>RDIMM memory modules untested, according to tpearson (they'll probably work)</li>
				<li>LRDIMM memory modules are currently incompatible</li>
				<li>
					SAS (via PIKE 2008 module) requires non-free option ROM (and SeaBIOS) to boot from it
					(theoretically possible to replace, but you can put a kernel in CBFS or on SATA
					and use that to boot GNU, which can be on a SAS drive. The linux kernel can use
					those SAS drives (via PIKE module) without an option ROM).
				</li>
				<li>
					IPMI iKVM module (optional add-on card) uses proprietary firmware. Since it's for
					remote out-of-band management, it's theoretically a backdoor similar to the Intel
					Management Engine. Fortunately, unlike the ME, this firmware is unsigned which
					means that a free replacement is theoretically possible. For now, the libreboot project
					recommends not installing the module. <a href="https://github.com/facebook/openbmc">This project</a>
					might be interesting to derive from, for those who want to work on a free replacement.
					In practise, out-of-band management isn't very useful anyway (or at the very least,
					it's not a major inconvenience to not have it).
				</li>
				<li>Graphics: only text-mode works. See <a href="#graphics">#graphics</a></li>
				<li>
					Potential issues with the 2nd NIC (see footnote 7 on 
					<a href="https://raptorengineeringinc.com/coreboot/kgpe-d16-status.php">KGPE-D16 status page</a>)
