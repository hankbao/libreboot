				It is believed that all or most R400 laptops are compatible. 
				See notes about <a href="../install/r400_external.html#cpu_compatibility">CPU compatibility</a> for
				potential incompatibilities.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				There are two possible flash chip sizes for the R400: 4MiB (32Mbit) or 8MiB (64Mbit). 
				This can be identified by the type of flash chip below the palmrest: 4MiB is SOIC-8, 8MiB
				is SOIC-16.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				<b>The R400 laptops come with the ME (and sometimes AMT in addition) before flashing libreboot. Libreboot disables and removes it
				by using a modified descriptor: see <a href="gm45_remove_me.html">gm45_remove_me.html</a></b> (contains notes, plus
				instructions)
			</p>

				Flashing instructions can be found at <a href="../install/index.html#flashrom">../install/index.html#flashrom</a>

				<h3 id="hwvirt">Hardware virtualization (vt-x)</h3>
					<p>
						The R400, when run without CPU microcode updates in coreboot, currently kernel panics
						if running QEMU with vt-x enabled on 2 cores for the guest. With a single core enabled
						for the guest, the guest panics (but the host is fine). Working around this in QEMU
						might be possible; if not, software virtualization should work fine (it's just slower).
					</p>
					<p>
						On GM45 hardware (with libreboot), make sure that the <i>kvm</i> and <i>kvm_intel</i> kernel modules
						are not loaded, when using QEMU.
					</p>
					<p>
						The following errata datasheet from Intel might help with investigation:

			The R400 is almost identical to the X200, code-wise. See <a href="x200.html">x200.html</a>.

			TODO: put hardware register logs here like on the <a href="x200.html">X200</a> and <a href="t400.html">T400</a> page.
