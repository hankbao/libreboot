		<h1 id="pagetop">Intel D510MO desktop board</h1>

		<p>
			This is a desktop board using intel hardware (circa ~2009, ICH7 southbridge, similar performance-wise to the Libreboot X200. It can make for quite a nifty desktop. Powered by libreboot.
		</p>
		<p>
		    NOTE: This board has a working framebuffer in Grub, but in GNU/Linux in native resolution the display is unusable due to some raminit issues.
            This board can however be used for building a headless server.
        </p>
