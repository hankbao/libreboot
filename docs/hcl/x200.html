				It is believed that all X200 laptops are compatible. X200S and X200 Tablet will
				also work, <a href="#x200s">depending on the configuration</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				It *might* be possible to put an X200 motherboard in an X201 chassis, though this is currently untested
				by the libreboot project. The same may also apply between X200S and X201S; again, this is untested.
				<b>It's most likely true.</b>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				There are two possible flash chip sizes for the X200: 4MiB (32Mbit) or 8MiB (64Mbit). 
				This can be identified by the type of flash chip below the palmrest: 4MiB is SOIC-8, 8MiB
				is SOIC-16.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				<b>The X200 laptops come with the ME (and sometimes AMT in addition) before flashing libreboot. Libreboot disables and removes it
				by using a modified descriptor: see <a href="gm45_remove_me.html">gm45_remove_me.html</a></b> (contains notes, plus
				instructions)

            <p>
                It is recommended that you update to the latest EC firmware version.
                The <a href="https://libreboot.org/faq/#firmware-ec">EC firmware</a>
                is separate from libreboot, so we don't actually provide that, but
                if you still have Lenovo BIOS then you can just run the Lenovo BIOS
                update utility, which will update both the BIOS and EC version.
                See:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://libreboot.org/docs/install/index.html#flashrom">https://libreboot.org/docs/install/index.html#flashrom</a></li>
                <li><a href="http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/BIOS_update_without_optical_disk">http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/BIOS_update_without_optical_disk</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                NOTE: this can only be done when you are using Lenovo BIOS. How to
                update the EC firmware while running libreboot is unknown. 
                Libreboot only replaces the BIOS firmware, not EC.
            </p>
            <p>
                Updated EC firmware has several advantages e.g.
                bettery battery handling.

					<p>
						The X200, when run without CPU microcode updates in coreboot, currently kernel panics
						if running QEMU with vt-x enabled on 2 cores for the guest. With a single core enabled
						for the guest, the guest panics (but the host is fine). Working around this in QEMU
						might be possible; if not, software virtualization should work fine (it's just slower).
					</p>
					<p>
						On GM45 hardware (with libreboot), make sure that the <i>kvm</i> and <i>kvm_intel</i> kernel modules
						are not loaded, when using QEMU.
					</p>

		<h2 id="x200s">X200S and X200 Tablet.</h2>

			<p>
				X200S and X200 Tablet have raminit issues at the time of writing
				(GS45 chipset. X200 uses GM45).
			</p>

			<p>
				X200S and X200 Tablet are known to work, but only with certain CPU+RAM configurations.
				The current stumbling block is RCOMP and SFF, mentioned in
				<a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~410/doc/minimal_boot.pdf">https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~410/doc/minimal_boot.pdf</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				The issues mostly relate to raminit (memory initialization). With an
				unpatched coreboot, you get the following: <a href="text/x200s/cblog00.txt">text/x200s/cblog00.txt</a>.
				No SODIMM combination that was tested would work. At first glance, it looks
				like GS45 (chipset that X200S uses. X200 uses GM45) is unsupported, but
				there is a workaround that can be used to make certain models of the X200S
				work, depending on the RAM.
			</p>
			<p>
				The datasheet for GS45 describes two modes: low-performance and
				high-performance. Low performance uses the SU range of ultra-low
				voltage procesors (SU9400, for example), and high-performance uses the
				SL range of processors (SL9400, for example). According to datasheets,
				GS45 behaves very similarly to GM45 when operating in high-performance
				mode.
			</p>
			<p>
				The theory then was that you could simply remove
				the checks in coreboot and make it pass GS45 off as GM45; the idea is
				that, with a high-performance mode CPU (SL9400, for example) it would
				just boot up and work.
			</p>
			<p>
				This suspicion was confirmed with the following log:
				<a href="text/x200s/cblog01.txt">text/x200s/cblog01.txt</a>.
				The memory modules in this case are 2x4GB. <s><b>However, not all
				configurations work: <a href="text/x200s/cblog02.txt">text/x200s/cblog02.txt</a> (2x2GB)
				and <a href="text/x200s/cblog03.txt">text/x200s/cblog03.txt</a> (1x2GB)
				show a failed bootup.</b></s> <i>False alarm. The modules were mixed (non-matching). X200S 
				with high-performance mode CPU will work so long as you use matching memory modules
				(doesn't matter what size).</i>
			</p>
			<p>
				This was then pushed as a patch for coreboot, which can be found at
				<a href="http://review.coreboot.org/#/c/7786/">http://review.coreboot.org/#/c/7786/</a>
				(libreboot merges this patch in coreboot-libre now. Check the 'getcb' script in
				src or git).

			<div class="subsection">
				<h3 id="x200s_raminit">Proper GS45 raminit</h3>
					<p>
						A new northbridge gs45 should be added to coreboot, based on gm45,
						and a new port x200st (X200S and X200T) should be added based on
						the x200 port.
					</p>
					<p>
						This port would have proper raminit. Alternatively, gs45 (if
						raminit is taken to be the only issue with it) can be part of
						gm45 northbridge support (and X200S/Tablet being part of the X200
						port) with conditional checks in the raminit that make raminit
						work differently (as required) for GS45. nico_h and pgeorgi/patrickg
						in the coreboot IRC channel should know more about raminit on gm45
						and likely gs45.
					</p>
					<p>
						pgeorgi recommends to run SerialICE on the factory BIOS (for X200S),
						comparing it with X200 (factory BIOS) and X200 (gm45 raminit code
						in coreboot), to see what the differences are. Then tweak raminit
						code based on that.

							<b>If your X200 has an LED backlit panel in it, then you also need to get an inverter and harness cable

			<p>
				Some X200s have a CCFL backlight and some have an LED backlight, in their LCD panel. This

				the panel and/or inverter. (a CCFL inverter is high-voltage and will destroy an LED backlit panel).
			</p>
			<p>
				CCFLs contain mercury. An X200 with a CCFL backlight will (<b></b>unless it has been changed to an LED,
				with the correct inverter. Check with your supplier!</b>) the following: <i>&quot;This product
				contains Lithium Ion Battery, Lithium Battery and a lamp which contains mercury; dispose according to
				local, state or federal laws&quot;</i> (one with an LED backlit panel will say something different).

				pehjota started collecting some steppings for different CPUs on several X200 laptops.
				You can get the CPUID by running: <br/>
				$ <b>dmesg | sed -n 's/^.* microcode: CPU0 sig=0x\([^,]*\),.*$/\1/p'</b>

				 The laptops that have issues resuming from suspend, as well as a laptop that (as I mentioned earlier in #libreboot) won't boot with any Samsung DIMMs, all have CPUID 0x10676 (stepping M0).

				What pehjota wrote:
				Laptops with CPUID 0x167A (stepping R0) resume properly every time and work with Samsung DIMMs.  I'll

				What pehjota wrote:
				As I said, 10676 is M0 and 1067A is R0; those are the two CPUIDs and steppings for Intel Core 2 Duo P8xxx CPUs with factory microcode.  (1067 is the family and model, and 6 or A is the stepping ID.)

				It might not be coreboot that's buggy with raminit/S3; it might just be down to the microcode updates.

&lt;sgsit&gt; all the Wistron manufactured systems have this thing called a "golden finger", normally at the front edge of the board
