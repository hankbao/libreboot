% Thinkpad X60/X60s/X60t: Change keyboard

Use this guide to replace the keyboard on your ThinkPad X60. Also works
for X60s and X60 Tablet.

Although slightly different, this guide can also be followed for the
ThinkPad X200, X200S and X200 Tablet. The screws are in more or less the
same place, and it's the same procedure.
