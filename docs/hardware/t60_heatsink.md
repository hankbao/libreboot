% Changing heatsink (or CPU) on the ThinkPad T60

Using this guide you can also change/upgrade the CPU.

[Back to previous index](./)

Hardware requirements {#hardware_requirements}
=====================

-   rubbing alcohol or isopropyl alcohol, and thermal compound for
    changing CPU heatsink (procedure involves removing heatsink)

-   thermal compound/paste (Arctic MX-4 is good. Others are also good.)

Software requirements {#software_requirements}
=====================

-   xsensors
-   stress

Disassembly {#recovery}
===========

Remove those screws and remove the HDD:\

Lift off the palm rest:\

Lift up the keyboard, pull it back a bit, flip it over like that and
then disconnect it from the board:\

Gently wedge both sides loose:\

Remove that cable from the position:\

Remove the bezel (sorry forgot to take pics).

On the CPU (and there is another chip south-east to it, sorry forgot to
take pic) clean off the old thermal paste (with the alcohol) and apply
new (Artic Silver 5 is good, others are good too) you should also clean
the heatsink the same way\

This is also an opportunity to change the CPU to another one. For
example if you had a Core Duo T2400, you can upgrade it to a better
processor (higher speed, 64-bit support). A Core 2 Duo T7600 was
installed here.

Attach the heatsink and install the screws (also, make sure to install
the AC jack as highlighted):\

Reinstall that upper bezel:\

Place keyboard and (sorry, forgot to take pics) reinstall the palmrest
and insert screws on the underside:\

It lives!\

Always stress test ('stress -c 2' and xsensors. below 90C is ok) when
replacing cpu paste/heatsink:\
