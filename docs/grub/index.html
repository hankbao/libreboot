			<p>
				Use cbfstool from libreboot_util, or libreboot_src/coreboot/util/cbfstool/ if you want to build from source.
			</p>
			<p>
				./cbfstool yourrom.rom remove background.png -n background.png<br/>
				./cbfstool yourrom.rom add -f background.png -n background.png -t raw
			</p>
			<p>
				When you've done this, re-flash your ROM and you should have a new background at boot time.

		<h1 id="grub_font">Setting font in GRUB (for reference)</h1>

			<p>You don't need to do this unless you would like to change the default font yourself.
			(this is just for reference. It has already been done for you)</p>

			<p>The old font used was Unifont, and this had some missing characters: for instance, the border showed ??? characters instead of lines.</p>

			<p>I tried DeJavu Sans Mono from this website:
			<a href="http://dejavu-fonts.org/wiki/Download">dejavu-fonts.org</a></p>

			<p>Specifically, the version that I chose was the latest at the time of writing (Saturday 21 June 2014):
			<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/dejavu/files/dejavu/2.34/dejavu-fonts-ttf-2.34.tar.bz2">this one</a></p>

			<p>This is a free font that is also contained in GNU/Linux distributions like Trisquel or Parabola.</p>

			<p><b>$ cd libreboot_src/grub</b><br/>
			compile grub (the build scripts info on how to do this)<br/>
			come back out into libreboot_src/resources/grub:<br/>
			<b>$ cd ../libreboot_src/resources/grub/font</b></p>

			<p>I took Dejavu Sans Mono from dejavu (included in this version of libreboot) and did:<br/>
			<b>$ ../../../grub/grub-mkfont -o dejavusansmono.pf2 dejavu-fonts-ttf-2.34/ttf/DejaVuSansMono.ttf</b></p>

			<p>I then added the instructions to 'gen.sh' script in grub-assemble to include resources/grub/dejavusansmono.pf2
			in all of the ROM images, at the root of the GRUB memdisk.<br/>
			I then added that instructions to the grub.cfg files (to load the font):<br/>
			<b>loadfont (memdisk)/dejavusansmono.pf2</b></p>

				<h2 id="grub_custom_keyboard">Custom keyboard layout in GRUB (for reference)</h2>

					<p>
						Keymaps are stored in resources/utilities/grub-assemble/keymap/.
					</p>

					<p>
						Example (French Azerty):<br/>
						<b>$ ckbcomp fr &gt; frazerty</b><br/><br/>
						Go in grub directory:<br/>
						<b>cat frazerty | ./grub/grub-mklayout -o frazerty.gkb</b>
					</p>

					<p>
						You must make sure that the files are named keymap and keymap.gkb (where 'keymap' can be whatever you want).
					</p>

					<p>
						Then from the above example, you would put <b>frazerty</b> in <b>resources/utilities/grub-assemble/keymap/original/</b> and
						the <b>frazerty.gkb</b> file goes under <b>resources/utilities/grub-assemble/keymap/</b>
					</p>

					<p>
						The build scripts will automatically see this, and automatically build
						ROM images with your custom layout (given the name) and include them under bin. Example: <b>libreboot_frazerty.rom</b>.
					</p>

				<h2 id="grub_ukdvorak_keyboard">UK Dvorak keyboard layout in GRUB (for reference)</h2>

					<p>
						ukdvorak had to be created manually, based on usdvorak. diff them (under resources/utilities/grub-assemble/keymap/original)
						to see how ukdvorak file was created
					</p>

					<p><b>$ cat ukdvorak | ./grub/grub-mklayout -o ukdvorak.gkb</b></p>
