				Native gpu init + backlight controls! (Fn keys). Also confirmed on X60 Tablet (1024x768) and X60 Tablet (1400x1050)
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Add backlight controls:</b> in <i>src/mainboard/lenovo/x60/devicetree.cb</i>, change <b>gpu_backlight</b> to <b>0x879F879E</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				That's all! <b>This has also been backported into libreboot 5th release (line 1233 in src/mainboard/lenovo/x60/i915io.c)</b>. GNUtoo (Denis Carikli) 
				told me about the register <b>BLC_PWM_CTL</b> and that you could set it to control backlight. I read that address using devmem2 while running the VBIOS:<br/>
				<b># devmem2 0xe4361254 w</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				The change is also included in libreboot 6.
			</p>
			<p>
				When doing this, it gave back that value. The same trick was used to get backlight controls for T60 (see <a href="#t60_native_notes">#t60_native_notes</a>).
			</p>

			<h2>Further notes</h2>
				<p>
					Reading <b>0xe4361254</b> (address) in Lenovo BIOS always yields FFFFFFFF, even when writing to it (and writing to it doesn't affect brightness controls). 
					'mtjm' on IRC found that the buttons (Fn keys) control /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0 which has no affect on 61254 (BLC_PWM_CTL). He says
					intel_backlight has different values and uses the register. devmem2 works, needs checking <b>lspci -vv</b> for where the memory is mapped,
					which is different than on coreboot; mtjm found that it was 0xec061254 on his machine (X60 Tablet), and the register value is different too.
					<b>This is relevant, because we still don't know how backlight controls are actually handled. We got it working by accident. We need to know more.</b>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Intel-gpu-tools may prove useful for further debugging: <a href="http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/app/intel-gpu-tools/">http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/app/intel-gpu-tools/</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					mtjm says 0xe4300000 is an MMIO region of the gpu (lspci -vv shows it), 0x61254 (BLC_PWM_CTL) is a documented register. Searching the kernel driver for backlight
					shows that in intel_panel.c this register is used (there is an XXX comment about finding the right value, where recent kernels get it from.
				</p>
				<p>
					What we want to do is calculate a good value, instead of setting it in devicetree.cb. mtjm says about backlight physics:
					it has a light source , uses pulse width modulation (PWM) to turn it on/off, dimming is done by spending less time on. 
					<b>Note: this may not be correct; he says his understanding is based on how the Lenote yeeloong works</b>.
				</p>
				<p>
					mtjm goes on to say, that the register specifies the frequency used for PWM in its depending on the GPU core frequency, so it
					might be possible to calculate it without hardcoded laptop-specific values. Therefore, I am supposed to find out the 'display core frequency'
					(mtjm says there might be a register for it; also, it might be in 5320 or the replay code) and the PWM modulation frequency.

				</p>
				<p>
					phcoder (Vladimir Serbinenko) who is author of 5320 (review.coreboot.org) talks about 'duty cycle limit' and 'flickering frequency'.

		<h1 id="5320_kernel312fix">i945: 3D fix (based on 5927) for kernel 3.12+ on 5320</h1>

			<p>
				<b>
					This is now obsolete. Merged in coreboot: <a href="http://review.coreboot.org/#/c/5927/">http://review.coreboot.org/#/c/5927/</a>
				</b>
			</p>

			<p><b>This needs to be rewritten (or better organized, or deleted?)</b>. This is also now included in libreboot 6 (using the proper way, not the 7c0000 method which was a hack)</p>

			<p>
				<b>This was done on 5320/6 so far. The fix below is for 5320/6 which is now obsolete. This needs to be re-done for the latest version
				of 5320. The fix below is (in practise) only for reference, therefore.</b>
			</p>

			<p>
				See <a href="#x60_cb5927_testing">#x60_cb5927_testing</a> for the original (and current) fix, for the replay code. Now we want
				to implement that on top of <a href="http://review.coreboot.org/#/c/5320">http://review.coreboot.org/#/c/5320</a>
				which is the current code for native graphics initialization on i945.
			</p>

			<p>
				src/northbridge/intel/i945/gma.c (using the 7c0000 hack) on 5320: <a href="dumps/5320_7c0000_gma.c">5320_7c0000_gma.c</a> (rename it to gma.c, 
				replacing the current one). 
			</p>

			<p>
				The above is a hack (as is the original). A better (more correct) method is implemented in later versions of 5927, so 
				that should also be adapted for 5320. For now, you can use the above fix.
			</p>

			<p>
				The correct way to do it is to set gtt address to (end of stolen memory - gtt size), which is what later versions of 5927 do (successfully).
			</p>

			<p>
				Here is some debugging output using intel_gpu_tools v1.2-1 (from trisquel repositories) using tool "intel_gtt":

				<a href="dumps/kernel312_irc">kernel312_irc</a>.
			</p>

			<p>
				PGETBL_CTL differs between VBIOS (-) and native graphics init (+).<br/>

				+          PGETBL_CTL: 0x3f800001
			</p>

			<p>GTT (graphics translation table) size is PGETBL_save, max 256 KiB. BSM (Base of Stolen Memory) is given by the bios.</p>
