			<p>
				Before doing anything, you need the dependencies first. This is true if
				you want to build libreboot from source, with either libreboot_src.tar.xz or git.
				<b>If you are using libreboot_util.tar.xz (binary archive) then you can ignore this, because
				ROM images and statically compiled executables for the utilities are included.</b>
			</p>

			<div class="important">
				<p>
					For Trisquel 7, you can run the following command:<br/>
					$ <b>sudo ./build dependencies trisquel7</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					For Parabola, you can run the following command:<br/>
					$ <b>sudo ./build dependencies parabola</b><br/>
					or:<br/>
					# <b>./build dependencies parabola</b>
				</p>

			<p>
				For other GNU/Linux distributions, you can adapt the existing scripts.

		<h1 id="build_meta">Get the full source code from metadata (git clone)</h1>

			<p>
				If you downloaded libreboot from git, then there are some steps to download and patch
				the source code for all relevant dependencies. The archive in the git repository used to be
				available as a tarball called 'libreboot_meta.tar.gz'. It contains 'metadata' (scripts) 
				which define how the source was created (where it came from).
			</p>

			<p>
				You can use the scripts included to download everything.
			</p>

			<p>
				First, <a href="#build_dependencies">install the build dependencies</a>.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Since libreboot makes extensive use of git, you need to configure git properly. If you have not yet configured
				git, then the minimum requirement is:<br/>
				$ <b>git config --global user.name "Your Name"</b><br/>
				$ <b>git config --global user.email your@emailaddress.com</b><br/>
				This is what will also appear in git logs if you ever commit your own changes to a given repository. For
				more information, see <a href="http://git-scm.com/doc">http://git-scm.com/doc</a>.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Another nice config for you (optional, but recommended):<br/>
				$ <b>git config --global core.editor nano</b><br/>
				$ <b>git config --global color.status auto</b><br/>
				$ <b>git config --global color.branch auto</b><br/>
				$ <b>git config --global color.interactive auto</b><br/>
				$ <b>git config --global color.diff auto</b>
			</p>

			<p>
				After that, run the script:<br/>
				$ <b>./download all</b>
			</p>

			<p>
				What this did was download everything (grub, coreboot, memtest86+, bucts, flashrom)
				at the versions last tested for this release, and patch them. Read the script
				in a text editor to learn more.
			</p>

		<h1 id="build_bucts">How to build &quot;bucts&quot; (for LenovoBIOS X60/X60S/X60T/T60)</h1>

			<p>
				<b>This is for Lenovo BIOS users on the ThinkPad X60/X60S, X60 Tablet and T60. If you have coreboot or libreboot running already, ignore this.</b>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				BUC.TS isn't really specific to these laptops, but is a bit inside the a register in the chipset on some Intel systems.
			</p>

			<p>
				Bucts is needed when flashing in software the X60/X60S/X60T/T60 ROM while Lenovo BIOS is running;
				external flashing will be safe regardless.
				Each ROM contains identical data inside the two final 64K region in the file*.
				This corresponds to the final two 64K regions in the flash chip. Lenovo BIOS will prevent you from writing the
				final one, so running &quot;<b>bucts 1</b>&quot; will set the system to boot from the other block instead (which
				is writeable along with everything beneath it when using a patched flashrom. see <a href="#build_flashrom">#build_flashrom</a>). 
				After shutting down and booting up after the first flash of libreboot,
				the final 64K block is writeable so you flash the ROM again with an unpatched flashrom and run "<b>bucts 0</b>" to
				make the system boot from the normal (highest) block again.
			</p>

			<p>
				*Libreboot ROM images have identical data in those two 64KiB regions because dd is used to do that, by the build system.
				If you're building from upstream (coreboot), you have to do it manually.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				BUC.TS is backed up (powered) by the NVRAM battery (or CMOS battery, as some people call it). On thinkpads,
				this is typically in a yellow plastic package with the battery inside, connected via power lines to the
				mainboard. Removing that battery removes power to BUC.TS, resetting the bit back to 0 (if you previously set
				it to 1).
			</p>

			<p>
				BUC.TS utility is included in libreboot_src.tar.xz and libreboot_util.tar.xz.<br/>
				<b>If you downloaded from git, follow <a href="#build_meta">#build_meta</a> before you proceed.</b>
			</p>

			<p>
				&quot;BUC&quot; means &quot;<b>B</b>ack<b>u</b>p <b>C</b>ontrol&quot; (it's a register) and &quot;TS&quot; means &quot;<b>T</b>op <b>S</b>wap&quot;
				(it's a status bit). Hence &quot;bucts&quot; (BUC.TS). TS 1 and TS 0 corresponds to bucts 1 and bucts 0.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				If you have the binary release archive, you'll find executables under ./bucts/. Otherwise if you need to build from source, continue reading.
			</p>

			<p>
				First, <a href="#build_dependencies">install the build dependencies</a>.
			</p>

			<p>
				To build bucts, do this in the main directory:<br/>
				$ <b>./build module bucts</b>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				To statically compile it, do this:<br/>
				$ <b>./build module bucts static</b>
			</p>

			<p>
				The &quot;builddeps&quot; script in libreboot_src also makes use of builddeps-bucts.

	<div class="section">

		<h1 id="build_flashrom">How to build &quot;flashrom&quot;</h1>

			<p>
				Flashrom is the utility for flashing/dumping ROM images. This is what you will use to install libreboot.
			</p>

			<p>
				Flashrom source code is included in libreboot_src.tar.xz and libreboot_util.tar.xz.<br/>
				<b>If you downloaded from git, follow <a href="#build_meta">#build_meta</a> before you proceed.</b>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				If you are using the binary release archive, then there are already binaries included
				under ./flashrom/. The flashing scripts will try to choose the correct one for you. Otherwise
				if you wish to re-build flashrom from source, continue reading.
			</p>

			<p>
				First, <a href="#build_dependencies">install the build dependencies</a>.
			</p>

			<p>
				To build it, do the following in the main directory:<br/>
				$ <b>./build module flashrom</b>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				To statically compile it, do the following in the main directory:<br/>
				$ <b>./build module flashrom static</b>
			</p>

			<p>
				After you've done that, under ./flashrom/ you will find the following executables:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>flashrom</b>
					<ul>
						<li>For flashing while coreboot or libreboot is running.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>flashrom_lenovobios_sst</b>
					<ul>
						<li>This is patched for flashing while Lenovo BIOS is running on an X60 or T60 with the SST25VF016B (SST) flash chip.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>flashrom_lenovobios_macronix</b>
					<ul>
						<li>This is patched for flashing while Lenovo BIOS is running on an X60 or T60 with the MX25L1605D (Macronix) flash chip.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				The &quot;builddeps&quot; script in libreboot_src also makes use of builddeps-flashrom.

		<h1 id="build">How to build the ROM images</h1>

			<p>You don't need to do much, as there are scripts already written for you that can build everything automatically.</p>

			<p>
				You can build libreboot from source on a 32-bit (i686) or 64-bit (x86_64) system. Recommended (if possible): x86_64.
				ASUS KFSN4-DRE has 64-bit CPUs.
				On a ThinkPad T60, you can replace the CPU (Core 2 Duo T5600, T7200 or T7600. T5600 recommended) for 64-bit support. 
				On an X60s, you can replace the board with one that has a Core 2 Duo L7400 (you could also use an X60 Tablet board with the same CPU).
				On an X60, you can replace the board with one that has a Core 2 Duo T5600 or T7200 (T5600 is recommended). All MacBook2,1 laptops
				are 64-bit, as are all ThinkPad X200, X200S, X200 Tablet, R400, T400 and T500 laptops. Warning: MacBook1,1 laptops are all 32-bit only.
			</p>

			<p>
				First, <a href="#build_dependencies">install the build dependencies</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you downloaded libreboot from git, refer to <a href="#build_meta">#build_meta</a>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Build all of the components used in libreboot:<br/>
				$ <b>./build module all</b>
			</p>

			<p>
				You can also build each modules separately, using <i>./build module modulename</i>.
				To see the possible values for <i>modulename</i>, use:<br/>
				$ <b>./build module list</b>
			</p>

			<p>
				After that, build the ROM images (for all boards):<br/>
				$ <b>./build roms withgrub</b><br/>
				Alternatively, you can build for a specific board or set of boards.
				For example:<br/>
				$ <b>./build roms withgrub x60</b><br/>
				$ <b>./build roms withgrub x200_8mb</b><br/>
				$ <b>./build roms withgrub x60 x200_8mb</b><br/>
				The list of board options can be found by looking at the directory
				names in <b>resources/libreboot/config/grub/</b>.
			</p>
			<p>
				For those boards which use the depcharge payload, you must use:
				$ <b>./build roms withdepthcharge</b><br/>
				You can also build for a specific board or set of boards. For example:<br/>
				$ <b>./build roms withdepthcharge veyron_speedy</b>
			</p>

			<p>
				To clean (reverse) everything, do the following:<br/>
				$ <b>./build clean all</b>
			</p>

			<p>
				The ROM images will be stored under <b>bin/<i>payload</i>/</b>,
				where <i>payload</i> could be <i>grub</i>, <i>depthcharge</i>, <i>seabios</i>, or
				whatever other payload those images were built for.

				<h2>Preparing release archives (optional)</h2>

					<p>
						<b>This is only confirmed to work (tested) in Trisquel 7. Parabola *fails* at this stage
						(for now). For all other distros, YMMV.</b>
					</p>

					<p>
						This is mainly intended for use with the git repository.
						These commands will work in the release archive (_src), unless otherwise noted below.
					</p>

					<p>
						The archives will appear under <i>release/${version}/</i>;
						${version} will either be set using <i>git describe</i> or,
						if a <i>version</i> file already exists (_src release archive),
						then it will simply re-use that.
					</p>

					<p>
						Tag the current commit, and that version will appear in both the ${version}
						string on the directory under <i>release/</i>, and in the file names of the
						archives. Otherwise, whatever git uses for <i>git describe --tags HEAD</i>
						will be used.
					</p>

					<p>
						Utilities (static executables):<br/>
						$ <b>./build release util</b>
					</p>
					<p>
						Archive containing flashrom and bucts source code:<br/>
						$ <b>./build release tobuild</b>
					</p>
					<p>
						Documentation archive (<b>does not work on _src release archive, only git</b>):<br/>
						$ <b>./build release docs</b>
					</p>
					<p>
						ROM image archives:<br/>
						$ <b>./build release roms</b>
					</p>
					<p>
						Source code archive:<br/>
						$ <b>./build release src</b>
					</p>
					<p>
						SHA512 sums of all other release archives that have been generated:<br/>
						$ <b>./build release sha512sums</b>
					</p>

					<p>
						If you are building on an i686 host, this will build statically linked 32-bit binaries in 
						the binary release archive that you created,
						for: <b>nvramtool, cbfstool, ich9deblob, cbmem</b>.
					</p>

					<p>
						If you are building on an x86_64 host, this will build statically linked 32- *and* 64-bit binaries for 
						<b>cbmem</b>, <b>ich9deblob</b>, <b>cbfstool</b> and <b>nvramtool</b>. 
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>To include statically linked i686 and x86_64 binaries for bucts and flashrom,
						you will need to build them on a chroot, a virtual system or a real
						system where the host uses each given architecture. These packages are difficult
						to cross-compile, and the libreboot project is still figuring out how to deal
						with them.</b>
					</p>
					<p>
						The same applies if you want to include statically linked flashrom binaries for ARM.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						armv7l binaries (tested on a BeagleBone Black) are also included in libreboot_util, for:
					</p>
						<ul>
							<li>cbfstool</li>
							<li>ich9gen</li>
							<li>ich9deblob</li>
							<li>flashrom</li>
						</ul>

					<p>
						If you are building binaries on a live system or chroot (for flashrom/bucts), you can use the following to statically link them:<br/>
						$ <b>./build module flashrom static</b><br/>
						$ <b>./build module bucts static</b>
					</p>
					
					<p>
						The same conditions as above apply for ARM (except, building bucts on ARM is pointless, and for flashrom
						you only need the normal executable since the lenovobios_sst and _macronix executables are meant
						to run on an X60/T60 while lenovo bios is present, working around the security restrictions).
					</p>
					
					<p>
						The command that you used for generating the release archives will also run the following command:<br/>
						$ <b>./build release tobuild</b><br/>
						The archive <b>tobuild.tar.xz</b> will have been created under <b>release/</b>, containing bucts, flashrom and all other required
						resources for building them.
					</p>

					<p>
						You'll find that the files libreboot_util.tar.xz and libreboot_src.tar.xz have been created, under <b>release/</b>.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						The ROM images will be stored in separate archives for each system, under <b>release/rom/</b>.
					</p>
