			<p>Initial flashing instructions for R400.</p>
			<p>
				This guide is for those who want libreboot on their ThinkPad R400
				while they still have the original Lenovo BIOS present. This guide
				can also be followed (adapted) if you brick your R400, to know how
				to recover.
			</p>
			<p>
				Before following this section, please make sure to setup your libreboot ROM properly first. 
				Although ROM images are provided pre-built in libreboot, there are some modifications that 
				you need to make to the one you chose before flashing. (instructions referenced later in
				this guide)

		<h2 id="serial_port">Serial port</h2>
		
			<p>
				EHCI debug might not be needed. It has been reported that the docking station
				for this laptop has a serial port, so it might be possible to use that instead.

		<h1>A note about CPUs</h1>
			<p>
				<a href="http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Category:R400">ThinkWiki</a> has a list of CPUs
				for this system. The Core 2 Duo P8400 and P8600 are believed to work in libreboot.
				The Core 2 Duo T9600 was confirmed to work, so the T9400 probably also works.
				<b>The Core 2 Duo T5870/5670 and Celeron M 575/585 are untested!</b>
			</p>
			
			<h2>Quad-core CPUs</h2>
			
				<p>
					Although blocked by lenovobios (as was reported), it is reported that there are quad-core CPUs
					for GM45. This laptop has socketed CPUs, so it might be possible to use them
					(they are untested in coreboot; support may have to be added).
					Core 2 Quad Q9000, Q9100 or QX9300.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Look at this link:<br/>

	<div class="section" id="switchable_graphics">
	
		<h1>A note about GPUs</h1>
		
			<p>
				Some models have an Intel GPU, while others have both an ATI and an Intel GPU; this
				is referred to as &quot;switchable graphics&quot;. In the <i>BIOS setup</i> programme
				for lenovobios, you can specify that the system will use one or the other (but not both).
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Libreboot is known to work on systems with only the Intel GPU, using native graphics initialization.
				On systems with switchable graphics, it is believed that the ATI chip is used by default; coreboot
				was tested with the native init and it didn't work, so the theory is that you have to disable
				the ATI chip and make it use the Intel GPU instead (with native graphics), using the same method
				as lenovobios. The other alternative is to implement native graphics initialization for the ATI chip
				used on some models, but this is much harder (disabling the ATI chip in favour of Intel is likely much easier).
			</p>
			
			<p>
				For now (unless you want to help make systems with switchable graphics work, where a display
				is initialized for the Intel GPU), you should avoid systems with switchable graphics.
			</p>

		<h1 id="flashchips">Flash chips</h1>
		
			<p>
				There are two possible flash chip sizes for the R400: 4MiB
				(32Mbit) or 8MiB (64Mbit). This can be identified by the type
				of flash chip present: 4MiB is SOIC-8 (8 pins), 8MiB
				is SOIC-16 (16 pins).

	<div class="section photos">
	
		<h1 id="macaddress">MAC address</h1>
		
			<p>
				On the R400, the MAC address for the onboard
				gigabit ethernet chipset is stored inside the flash chip,
				along with other configuration data.
			</p>
			<p>
				Keep a note of the MAC address before disassembly; this is
				very important, because you will need to insert this into
				the libreboot ROM image before flashing it.
				It will be written in one of these locations:

				<p>
					Now, you should be ready to install libreboot.
				</p>
		
				<p>
					Flashrom binaries for ARM (tested on a BBB) are distributed in libreboot_util. Alternatively,
					libreboot also distributes flashrom source code which can be built.
				</p>
				<p>
					Log in as root on your BBB, using the instructions in <a href="bbb_setup.html#bbb_access">bbb_setup.html#bbb_access</a>. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Test that flashrom works:<br/>
					# <b>./flashrom -p linux_spi:dev=/dev/spidev1.0,spispeed=512</b><br/>
					In this case, the output was:

Please specify which chip definition to use with the -c &lt;chipname&gt; option.
</pre>
				<p>
					How to backup factory.rom (change the -c option as neeed, for your flash chip):<br/>
					# <b>./flashrom -p linux_spi:dev=/dev/spidev1.0,spispeed=512 -r factory.rom</b><br/>
					# <b>./flashrom -p linux_spi:dev=/dev/spidev1.0,spispeed=512 -r factory1.rom</b><br/>
					# <b>./flashrom -p linux_spi:dev=/dev/spidev1.0,spispeed=512 -r factory2.rom</b><br/>
					Note: the <b>-c</b> option is not required in libreboot's patched flashrom, because
					the redundant flash chip definitions in <i>flashchips.c</i> have been removed.<br/>
					Now compare the 3 images:<br/>
					# <b>sha512sum factory*.rom</b><br/>
					If the hashes match, then just copy one of them (the factory.rom) to a safe place (on a drive connected to another machine, not
					the BBB). This is useful for reverse engineering work, if there is a desirable behaviour in the original firmware
					that could be replicated in coreboot and libreboot.
				</p>
				<p>
					Follow the instructions at <a href="../hcl/gm45_remove_me.html#ich9gen">../hcl/gm45_remove_me.html#ich9gen</a>
					to change the MAC address inside the libreboot ROM image, before flashing it.
					Although there is a default MAC address inside the ROM image, this is not what you want. <b>Make sure
					to always change the MAC address to one that is correct for your system.</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					Now flash it:<br/>
					# <b>./flashrom -p linux_spi:dev=/dev/spidev1.0,spispeed=512 -w path/to/libreboot/rom/image.rom -V</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					<img src="images/x200/disassembly/0015.jpg" alt="" />
				</p>
				<p>
					You might see errors, but if it says <b>Verifying flash... VERIFIED</b> at the end, then it's flashed and should boot.
					If you see errors, try again (and again, and again); the message <b>Chip content is identical to the requested image</b>
					is also an indication of a successful installation.
				</p>
				<p>
					Example output from running the command (see above):

		<h1>Thermal paste (IMPORTANT)</h1>

				Because part of this procedure involved removing the heatsink, you will need to apply new paste.

			</p>
			
			<p>
				When re-installing the heatsink, you must first clean off all old paste with the alcohol/cloth.
				Then apply new paste. AS5 is also much better than the default paste used on these machines.
