				This guide is for those who want libreboot on their ThinkPad T500
				while they still have the original Lenovo BIOS present. This guide
				can also be followed (adapted) if you brick your T500, to know how
				to recover.

				EHCI debug might not be needed. It has been reported that the docking station
				for this laptop has a serial port, so it might be possible to use that instead.

		<h1>A note about CPUs</h1>
			<p>
				<a href="http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Category:T500">ThinkWiki</a> has a list of CPUs
				for this system. The Core 2 Duo P8400, P8600 and P8700 are believed to work in libreboot.
				The T9600 was also tested on the T400 and confirmed working, so the T9400/T9500/T9550 probably
				also work, but they are untested.

	<div class="section" id="switchable_graphics">
	
		<h1>A note about GPUs</h1>
		
			<p>
				This guide currently assumes that you have an Intel GPU (non-switchable).
				Some T500 have switchable graphics (ATI), which means that you can choose between ATI or Intel
				in the <i>BIOS setup</i>. When switching to Intel, is lenovobios not enabling ATI
				(where ATI is disabled by default and the system uses the Intel chip), or are they
				disabling it (where the system uses the ATI chip by default)?
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Basically, switchable graphics is untested, but it should be easy to get it working
				(if it doesn't already work).

			<p>
				On the T500, the MAC address for the onboard
				gigabit ethernet chipset is stored inside the flash chip,
				along with other configuration data.
			</p>
			<p>
				Keep a note of the MAC address before disassembly; this is
				very important, because you will need to insert this into
				the libreboot ROM image before flashing it.
				It will be written in one of these locations:

			<h2>
				The procedure
			</h2>
					
				<p>
					Remove all screws:<br/>
					<img src="images/t500/0000.jpg" alt="" /><br/>
					It is also advisable to, throughout the disassembly,
					place any screws and/or components that you removed in
					the same layout or arrangement. The follow photos demonstrate
					this:<br/>
					<img src="images/t500/0001.jpg" alt="" />
					<img src="images/t500/0002.jpg" alt="" />
				</p>
				<p>
					Remove the HDD/SSD and optical drive:<br/>
					<img src="images/t500/0003.jpg" alt="" />
					<img src="images/t500/0004.jpg" alt="" />
				</p>
				<p>
					Remove the palm rest:<br/>
					<img src="images/t500/0005.jpg" alt="" />
					<img src="images/t500/0006.jpg" alt="" />
				</p>
				<p>
					Remove the keyboard and rear bezel:<br/>
					<img src="images/t500/0007.jpg" alt="" />
					<img src="images/t500/0008.jpg" alt="" />
					<img src="images/t500/0009.jpg" alt="" />
					<img src="images/t500/0010.jpg" alt="" />
					<img src="images/t500/0011.jpg" alt="" />
					<img src="images/t500/0012.jpg" alt="" />
				</p>
				<p>
					If you have a WWAN/3G card and/or sim card reader,
					remove them permanently. The WWAN-3G card has DMA, and
					proprietary firmware inside; the technology is identical
					to what is used in mobile phones, so it can also track
					your movements:<br/>
					<img src="images/t500/0013.jpg" alt="" />
					<img src="images/t500/0017.jpg" alt="" />
					<img src="images/t500/0018.jpg" alt="" />
				</p>
				<p>
					Remove this frame, and then remove the wifi chip:<br/>
					<img src="images/t500/0014.jpg" alt="" />
					<img src="images/t500/0015.jpg" alt="" />
					<img src="images/t500/0016.jpg" alt="" />
				</p>
				<p>
					Remove the speakers:<br/>
					<img src="images/t500/0019.jpg" alt="" />
					<img src="images/t500/0020.jpg" alt="" />
					<img src="images/t500/0021.jpg" alt="" />

					<img src="images/t500/0024.jpg" alt="" />
					<img src="images/t500/0025.jpg" alt="" />
				</p>
				<p>
					Remove the NVRAM battery (already removed in this photo):<br/>
					<img src="images/t500/0026.jpg" alt="" />
				</p>
				<p>
					When you re-assemble, you will be replacing the wifi chip
					with another. These two screws don't hold anything together,
					but they are included in your machine because the screw
					holes for half-height cards are a different size, so
					use these if you will be installing a half-height card:<br/>
					<img src="images/t500/0027.jpg" alt="" />
				</p>
				<p>
					Unroute the antenna wires:<br/>
					<img src="images/t500/0028.jpg" alt="" />
					<img src="images/t500/0029.jpg" alt="" />
					<img src="images/t500/0030.jpg" alt="" />
					<img src="images/t500/0031.jpg" alt="" />
				</p>
				<p>
					Disconnect the LCD cable from the motherboard:<br/>
					<img src="images/t500/0032.jpg" alt="" />
					<img src="images/t500/0033.jpg" alt="" />
				</p>
				<p>
					Remove the LCD assembly hinge screws, and then remove the LCD
					assembly:<br/>
					<img src="images/t500/0034.jpg" alt="" />
					<img src="images/t500/0035.jpg" alt="" />
					<img src="images/t500/0036.jpg" alt="" />
				</p>
				<p>
					Remove the fan and heatsink:<br/>
					<img src="images/t500/0037.jpg" alt="" />
					<img src="images/t500/0038.jpg" alt="" />
					<img src="images/t500/0039.jpg" alt="" />
				</p>
				<p>
					Remove this screw:<br/>
					<img src="images/t500/0040.jpg" alt="" />
				</p>
				<p>
					Remove these cables, keeping note of how and in what
					arrangement they are connected:<br/>
					<img src="images/t500/0041.jpg" alt="" />
					<img src="images/t500/0042.jpg" alt="" />
					<img src="images/t500/0043.jpg" alt="" />
					<img src="images/t500/0044.jpg" alt="" />
					<img src="images/t500/0045.jpg" alt="" />
					<img src="images/t500/0046.jpg" alt="" />
					<img src="images/t500/0047.jpg" alt="" />
					<img src="images/t500/0048.jpg" alt="" />
					<img src="images/t500/0049.jpg" alt="" />
				</p>
				<p>
					Disconnect the power jack:<br/>
					<img src="images/t500/0050.jpg" alt="" />
					<img src="images/t500/0051.jpg" alt="" />
				</p>
				<p>
					Remove the motherboard and cage from the base
					(the marked hole is where those cables were routed through):<br/>
					<img src="images/t500/0052.jpg" alt="" />
					<img src="images/t500/0053.jpg" alt="" />
				</p>
				<p>
					Remove all screws, arranging them in the same layout
					when placing the screws on a surface and marking each screw
					hole (this is to reduce the possibility of putting them
					back in the wrong holes):<br/>
					<img src="images/t500/0054.jpg" alt="" />
					<img src="images/t500/0055.jpg" alt="" />
				</p>
				<p>
					Also remove this:<br/>
					<img src="images/t500/0056.jpg" alt="" />
					<img src="images/t500/0057.jpg" alt="" />
				</p>
				<p>
					Separate the motherboard from the cage:<br/>
					<img src="images/t500/0058.jpg" alt="" />
					<img src="images/t500/0059.jpg" alt="" />
				</p>
				<p>
					The flash chip is next to the memory slots. On this
					machine, it was a SOIC-8 (4MiB or 32Mb) flash chip:<br/>
					<img src="images/t500/0060.jpg" alt="" />
				</p>
				<p>
					Connect your programmer, then connect GND and 3.3V<br/>
					<img src="images/t500/0061.jpg" alt="" /><br/>
					<img src="images/t400/0067.jpg" alt="" />
					<img src="images/t400/0069.jpg" alt="" />
					<img src="images/t400/0070.jpg" alt="" />
					<img src="images/t400/0071.jpg" alt="" />
				</p>
				<p>
					A dedicated 3.3V PSU was used to create this guide, but
					at ATX PSU is also fine:<br/>
					<img src="images/t400/0072.jpg" alt="" />
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Of course, make sure to turn on your PSU:<br/>
					<img src="images/x200/disassembly/0013.jpg" alt="" />
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Now, you should be ready to install libreboot.
				</p>
		
				<p>
					Flashrom binaries for ARM (tested on a BBB) are distributed in libreboot_util. Alternatively,
					libreboot also distributes flashrom source code which can be built.
				</p>
				<p>
					Log in as root on your BBB, using the instructions in <a href="bbb_setup.html#bbb_access">bbb_setup.html#bbb_access</a>. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Test that flashrom works:<br/>
					# <b>./flashrom -p linux_spi:dev=/dev/spidev1.0,spispeed=512</b><br/>
					In this case, the output was:

Please specify which chip definition to use with the -c &lt;chipname&gt; option.
</pre>
				<p>
					How to backup factory.rom (change the -c option as neeed, for your flash chip):<br/>
					# <b>./flashrom -p linux_spi:dev=/dev/spidev1.0,spispeed=512 -r factory.rom</b><br/>
					# <b>./flashrom -p linux_spi:dev=/dev/spidev1.0,spispeed=512 -r factory1.rom</b><br/>
					# <b>./flashrom -p linux_spi:dev=/dev/spidev1.0,spispeed=512 -r factory2.rom</b><br/>
					Note: the <b>-c</b> option is not required in libreboot's patched flashrom, because
					the redundant flash chip definitions in <i>flashchips.c</i> have been removed.<br/>
					Now compare the 3 images:<br/>
					# <b>sha512sum factory*.rom</b><br/>
					If the hashes match, then just copy one of them (the factory.rom) to a safe place (on a drive connected to another machine, not
					the BBB). This is useful for reverse engineering work, if there is a desirable behaviour in the original firmware
					that could be replicated in coreboot and libreboot.
				</p>
				<p>
					Follow the instructions at <a href="../hcl/gm45_remove_me.html#ich9gen">../hcl/gm45_remove_me.html#ich9gen</a>
					to change the MAC address inside the libreboot ROM image, before flashing it.
					Although there is a default MAC address inside the ROM image, this is not what you want. <b>Make sure
					to always change the MAC address to one that is correct for your system.</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					Now flash it:<br/>
					# <b>./flashrom -p linux_spi:dev=/dev/spidev1.0,spispeed=512 -w path/to/libreboot/rom/image.rom -V</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					<img src="images/x200/disassembly/0015.jpg" alt="" />
				</p>
				<p>
					You might see errors, but if it says <b>Verifying flash... VERIFIED</b> at the end, then it's flashed and should boot.
					If you see errors, try again (and again, and again); the message <b>Chip content is identical to the requested image</b>
					is also an indication of a successful installation.
				</p>

					Example output from running the command (see above):
