		<h1 id="bucts_brick">Brick type 1: bucts not reset.</h1>
			<p>
				You still have Lenovo BIOS, or you had libreboot running and you flashed another ROM; and you had bucts 1 set and
				the ROM wasn't dd'd.* or if Lenovo BIOS was present and libreboot wasn't flashed.<br/><br/>

				In this case, unbricking is easy: reset BUC.TS to 0 by removing that yellow cmos coin (it's a battery) and putting it back after a minute or two:<br/>
				<img src="../images/x60t_unbrick/0008.JPG" alt="" /><br/><br/>

				*Those dd commands should be applied to all newly compiled X60 ROM images (the ROM images in libreboot binary archives already have this applied!):<br/>
				dd if=coreboot.rom of=top64k.bin bs=1 skip=$[$(stat -c %s coreboot.rom) - 0x10000] count=64k<br/>
				dd if=coreboot.rom bs=1 skip=$[$(stat -c %s coreboot.rom) - 0x20000] count=64k | hexdump<br/>
				dd if=top64k.bin of=coreboot.rom bs=1 seek=$[$(stat -c %s coreboot.rom) - 0x20000] count=64k conv=notrunc<br/>
				(doing this makes the ROM suitable for use when flashing a system that still has Lenovo BIOS running,
				using those instructions: <a href="http://www.coreboot.org/Board:lenovo/x60/Installation">http://www.coreboot.org/Board:lenovo/x60/Installation</a>.
			</p>

	<div class="section">

		<h1 id="recovery">bad rom (or user error), system won't boot</h1>
			<p>
				In this scenario, you compiled a ROM that had an incorrect configuration, or there is an actual bug preventing your system from
				booting. Or, maybe, you set BUC.TS to 0 and shut down after first flash while Lenovo BIOS was running. In any case, your system is bricked and will not boot at all.
			</p>
			<p>
				&quot;Unbricking&quot; means flashing a known-good (working) ROM. The problem: you can't boot the system, making this difficult. In this situation, external hardware (see hardware requirements above) is needed which can flash the SPI chip (where libreboot resides).

			<p>
				Remove those screws:<br/>
				<img src="../images/x60t_unbrick/0001.JPG" alt="" />
			</p>

			<p>
				Remove the HDD:<br/>
				<img src="../images/x60t_unbrick/0002.JPG" alt="" />
			</p>

			<p>
				Push keyboard forward to loosen it:<br/>
				<img src="../images/x60t_unbrick/0003.JPG" alt="" />
			</p>

			<p>
				Lift:<br/>
				<img src="../images/x60t_unbrick/0004.JPG" alt="" />
			</p>

			<p>
				Remove those:<br/>

			</p>

			<p>
				
				<img src="../images/x60t_unbrick/0006.JPG" alt="" />
			</p>

			<p>
				Also remove that (marked) and unroute the antenna cables:<br/>
				<img src="../images/x60t_unbrick/0007.JPG" alt="" />
			</p>

			<p>
				For some X60T laptops, you have to unroute those too:<br/>
				<img src="../images/x60t_unbrick/0010.JPG" alt="" />
			</p>

			<p>
				Remove the LCD extend board screws. Also remove those screws (see blue marks) and remove/unroute the cables and remove the metal plate:<br/>
				<img src="../images/x60t_unbrick/0008.JPG" alt="" />
			</p>

			<p>
				Remove that screw and then remove the board:<br/>
				<img src="../images/x60t_unbrick/0009.JPG" alt="" />
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Now wire up the BBB and the Pomona with your PSU.<br/>
				Refer to <a href="bbb_setup.html">bbb_setup.html</a> for how to setup
				the BBB for flashing.<br/>
				<b>Note, the guide mentions a 3.3v DC PSU but you don't need this on the X60 Tablet:
				if you don't have or don't want to use an external PSU, then make
				sure not to connect the 3.3v leads mentioned in the guide;
				instead, connect the AC adapter (the one that normally charges your
				battery) so that the board has power (but don't boot it up)</b>
				<img src="../images/x60t_unbrick/0011.JPG" alt="" /><br/>
				Correlate the following with the BBB guide linked above:
			</p>
<pre>
POMONA 5250:
===  golden finger and wifi switch ====
 18              -       - 1
 22              -       - NC                    ---------- audio jacks are on this end
 NC              -       - 21
 3.3V (PSU)      -       - 17 - this is pin 1 on the flash chip
===  CPU fan ===
<i>This is how you will connect. Numbers refer to pin numbers on the BBB, on the plugs near the DC jack.</i>
</pre>

			<p>
				Connecting the BBB and pomona (in this image, an external 3.3v DC PSU was used):<br/>
				<img src="images/x60/th_bbb_flashing.jpg" alt="" />
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Flashrom binaries for ARM (tested on a BBB) are distributed in libreboot_util. Alternatively,
				libreboot also distributes flashrom source code which can be built.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				SSH'd into the BBB:<br/>
				# <b>./flashrom -p linux_spi:dev=/dev/spidev1.0,spispeed=512 -w yourrom.rom</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				It should be <b>Verifying flash... VERIFIED</b> at the end. If flashrom complains about multiple flash chip
				definitions detected, then choose one of them following the instructions in the output.
			</p>

			<p>
				Reverse the steps to re-assemble your system.
