	<h1 id="bucts_brick">Brick type 1: bucts not reset.</h1>
		<p>
			You still have Lenovo BIOS, or you had libreboot running and you flashed another ROM; and you had bucts 1 set and
			the ROM wasn't dd'd.* or if Lenovo BIOS was present and libreboot wasn't flashed.<br/><br/>

			In this case, unbricking is easy: reset BUC.TS to 0 by removing that yellow cmos coin (it's a battery) and putting it back after a minute or two:<br/>
			<img src="../images/x60_unbrick/0004.jpg" alt="" /><br/><br/>

			*Those dd commands should be applied to all newly compiled X60 ROM images (the ROM images in libreboot binary archives already have this applied!):<br/>
			dd if=coreboot.rom of=top64k.bin bs=1 skip=$[$(stat -c %s coreboot.rom) - 0x10000] count=64k<br/>
			dd if=coreboot.rom bs=1 skip=$[$(stat -c %s coreboot.rom) - 0x20000] count=64k | hexdump<br/>
			dd if=top64k.bin of=coreboot.rom bs=1 seek=$[$(stat -c %s coreboot.rom) - 0x20000] count=64k conv=notrunc<br/>
			(doing this makes the ROM suitable for use when flashing a machine that still has Lenovo BIOS running,
			using those instructions: <a href="http://www.coreboot.org/Board:lenovo/x60/Installation">http://www.coreboot.org/Board:lenovo/x60/Installation</a>.
		</p>

	<h1 id="recovery">bad rom (or user error), machine won't boot</h1>
		<p>
			In this scenario, you compiled a ROM that had an incorrect configuration, or there is an actual bug preventing your machine from
			booting. Or, maybe, you set BUC.TS to 0 and shut down after first flash while Lenovo BIOS was running. In any case, your machine is bricked and will not boot at all.
		</p>
		<p>
			&quot;Unbricking&quot; means flashing a known-good (working) ROM. The problem: you can't boot the machine, making this difficult. In this situation, external hardware (see hardware requirements above) is needed which can flash the SPI chip (where libreboot resides).

		<p>
			Remove those screws:<br/>
			<img src="../images/x60_unbrick/0000.jpg" alt="" />
		</p>
		<p>
			Push the keyboard forward (carefully):<br/>
			<img src="../images/x60_unbrick/0001.jpg" alt="" />
		</p>
		<p>
			Lift the keyboard up and disconnect it from the board:<br/>
			<img src="../images/x60_unbrick/0002.jpg" alt="" />
		</p>
		<p>
			Grab the right-hand side of the chassis and force it off (gently) and pry up the rest of the chassis:<br/>
			<img src="../images/x60_unbrick/0003.jpg" alt="" />
		</p>
		<p>
			You should now have this:<br/>
			<img src="../images/x60_unbrick/0004.jpg" alt="" />
		</p>
		<p>
			Disconnect the wifi antenna cables, the modem cable and the speaker:<br/>
			<img src="../images/x60_unbrick/0005.jpg" alt="" />
		</p>
		<p>
			Unroute the cables along their path, carefully lifting the tape that holds them in place. Then, disconnect the modem
			cable (other end) and power connection and unroute all the cables so that they dangle by the monitor hinge on the right-hand
			side:<br/>
			<img src="../images/x60_unbrick/0006.jpg" alt="" />
		</p>
		<p>
			Disconnect the monitor from the motherboard, and unroute the grey antenna cable, carefully lifting the tape
			that holds it into place:<br/>
			<img src="../images/x60_unbrick/0008.jpg" alt="" />
		</p>
		<p>
			Carefully lift the remaining tape and unroute the left antenna cable so that it is loose:<br/>
			<img src="../images/x60_unbrick/0009.jpg" alt="" />
		</p>
		<p>
			Remove the screw that is highlighted (do NOT remove the other one; it holds part of the heatsink (other side) into place):<br/>
			<img src="../images/x60_unbrick/0011.jpg" alt="" />
		</p>
		<p>
			Remove those screws:<br/>
			<img src="../images/x60_unbrick/0012.jpg" alt="" />
		</p>
		<p>
			Carefully remove the plate, like so:<br/>
			<img src="../images/x60_unbrick/0013.jpg" alt="" />
		</p>
		<p>
			Remove the SATA connector:<br/>
			<img src="../images/x60_unbrick/0014.jpg" alt="" />
		</p>
		<p>
			Now remove the motherboard (gently) and cast the lcd/chassis aside:<br/>
			<img src="../images/x60_unbrick/0015.jpg" alt="" />
		</p>
		<p>
			Lift back that tape and hold it with something. Highlighted is the SPI flash chip:<br/>
			<img src="../images/x60_unbrick/0016.jpg" alt="" />
		</p>
		<p>
			Now wire up the BBB and the Pomona with your PSU.<br/>
			Refer to <a href="bbb_setup.html">bbb_setup.html</a> for how to setup
			the BBB for flashing.<br/>
			<b>Note, the guide mentions a 3.3v DC PSU but you don't need this on the X60:
			if you don't have or don't want to use an external PSU, then make
			sure not to connect the red/black 3.3v leads mentioned in the guide;
			instead, connect the AC adapter (the one that normally charges your
			battery) so that the board has power (but don't boot it up)</b>
			<img src="../images/x60_unbrick/0017.jpg" alt="" /><br/>
			Correlate the following with the BBB guide linked above:
		</p>
<pre>
POMONA 5250:
===  golden finger and wifi switch ====
 18              -       - 1
 22              -       - NC                    ---------- audio jacks are on this end
 NC              -       - 21
 3.3V PSU RED    -       - 17 - this is pin 1 on the flash chip
===  CPU fan ===
<i>This is how you will connect. Numbers refer to pin numbers on the BBB, on the plugs near the DC jack.</i>
</pre>

		<p>
			Connecting the BBB and pomona (in this image, an external 3.3v DC PSU was used):<br/>
			<img src="images/x60/th_bbb_flashing.jpg" alt="" />
		</p>

		<p>
			SSH'd into the BBB:<br/>
			# <b>./flashrom -p linux_spi:dev=/dev/spidev1.0,spispeed=512 -w yourrom.rom</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			It should be <b>Verifying flash... VERIFIED</b> at the end. If flashrom complains about multiple flash chip
			definitions detected, then choose one of them following the instructions in the output.
		</p>

		<p>
			Remove the programmer and put it away somewhere. Put back the tape and press firmly over it:<br/>
			<img src="../images/x60_unbrick/0026.jpg" alt="" />
		</p>
		<p>
			Your empty chassis:<br/>
			<img src="../images/x60_unbrick/0027.jpg" alt="" />
		</p>
		<p>
			Put the motherboard back in:<br/>
			<img src="../images/x60_unbrick/0028.jpg" alt="" />
		</p>
		<p>
			Reconnect SATA:<br/>
			<img src="../images/x60_unbrick/0029.jpg" alt="" />
		</p>
		<p>
			Put the plate back and re-insert those screws:<br/>
			<img src="../images/x60_unbrick/0030.jpg" alt="" />
		</p>
		<p>
			Re-route that antenna cable around the fan and apply the tape:<br/>
			<img src="../images/x60_unbrick/0031.jpg" alt="" />
		</p>
		<p>
			Route the cable here and then (not shown, due to error on my part) reconnect the monitor cable to the motherboard
			and re-insert the screws:<br/>
			<img src="../images/x60_unbrick/0032.jpg" alt="" />
		</p>
		<p>
			Re-insert that screw:<br/>
			<img src="../images/x60_unbrick/0033.jpg" alt="" />
		</p>
		<p>
			Route the black antenna cable like so:<br/>
			<img src="../images/x60_unbrick/0034.jpg" alt="" />
		</p>
		<p>
			Tuck it in neatly like so:<br/>
			<img src="../images/x60_unbrick/0035.jpg" alt="" />
		</p>
		<p>
			Route the modem cable like so:<br/>
			<img src="../images/x60_unbrick/0036.jpg" alt="" />
		</p>
		<p>
			Connect modem cable to board and tuck it in neatly like so:<br/>
			<img src="../images/x60_unbrick/0037.jpg" alt="" />
		</p>
		<p>
			Route the power connection and connect it to the board like so:<br/>
			<img src="../images/x60_unbrick/0038.jpg" alt="" />
		</p>
		<p>
			Route the antenna and modem cables neatly like so:<br/>
			<img src="../images/x60_unbrick/0039.jpg" alt="" />
		</p>
		<p>
			Connect the wifi antenna cables. At the start of the tutorial, this machine had an Intel wifi chip. Here you see I've replaced it with an 
			Atheros AR5B95 (supports 802.11n and can be used without blobs):<br/>
			<img src="../images/x60_unbrick/0040.jpg" alt="" />
		</p>
		<p>
			Connect the modem cable:<br/>
			<img src="../images/x60_unbrick/0041.jpg" alt="" />
		</p>
		<p>
			Connect the speaker:<br/>
			<img src="../images/x60_unbrick/0042.jpg" alt="" />
		</p>
		<p>
			You should now have this:<br/>
			<img src="../images/x60_unbrick/0043.jpg" alt="" />
		</p>
		<p>
			Re-connect the upper chassis:<br/>
			<img src="../images/x60_unbrick/0044.jpg" alt="" />
		</p>
		<p>
			Re-connect the keyboard:<br/>
			<img src="../images/x60_unbrick/0045.jpg" alt="" />
		</p>
		<p>
			Re-insert the screws that you removed earlier:<br/>
			<img src="../images/x60_unbrick/0046.jpg" alt="" />
		</p>
		<p>
			Power on!<br/>
			<img src="../images/x60_unbrick/0047.jpg" alt="" />
		</p>
		<p>
			Trisquel live USB menu (using the GRUB ISOLINUX parser):<br/>
			<img src="../images/x60_unbrick/0048.jpg" alt="" />
		</p>
		<p>
			Trisquel live desktop:<br/>
